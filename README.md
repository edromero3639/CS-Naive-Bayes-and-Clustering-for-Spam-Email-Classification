# CS-Naive-Bayes-and-Clustering-for-Spam-Email-Classification
An IT Department identified that company employees have been receiving a large amount of spam emails and request that we create a dataset that is a collection of both spam and normal emails, then build a model to identify spam and non-spam emails. We, the data scientist, will be using a Clustering and Naïve Bayes method to create an email filter that will improve emails that gets put into our inbox and those that are placed into a “spam” folder. Our model evaluation metric will be precision given we are prioritizing being able to predict a normal (true positive); we do not want to miss reading important emails because they were identified as spam.
